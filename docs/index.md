Welcome to my little website! I'm a software engineer. I'm interested in a few things:
- I've been learning about LLMs since about a year before it was cool
- I'm interested in optimizing organizational processes
- I like programming and computers and learning a little bit more than I absolutely have to about how it works
- I also like learning about global development, economic policy, local politics, short fiction, and biology
- I read and listen to audiobooks and try to review most books I've consumed
- I sometimes write things
- I run and do yoga too

Here's where I can be found elsewhere on the Internet:
