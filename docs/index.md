Welcome to my little website! I'm a Software Engineer dabbling in writing. I'm interested in a few things:
- I've been learning about AI for about a year or two before it was cool
- I'm interested in optimizing organizational processes
- I like programming and computers and learning a little bit more than I absolutely have to about how it works
- I like learning about global development, economic policy, local politics, short fiction, and biology
- I like reading and try to review most books I read
- I sometimes write things
- I like to run and do yoga too

Here's where I can be found elsewhere on the Internet:
